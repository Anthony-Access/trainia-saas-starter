# Tech Stack Document for Train-IA

This document explains the technologies behind Train-IA in plain language. We cover why each tool was chosen and how they work together to deliver a reliable, user-friendly SaaS application.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

These technologies handle everything the user sees and interacts with in their browser:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**  
  A modern framework built on React. It helps us create fast, search-engine-friendly pages for your public website (landing page) and a smooth, secure experience inside your app once you’re signed in.

- **TypeScript**  
  A version of JavaScript that adds checks for potential errors before the code runs. This makes the app more reliable and easier to maintain as it grows.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first styling tool that lets us build custom designs quickly without writing long CSS files. It keeps the interface consistent and easy to tweak.

- **shadcn/ui**  
  A set of pre-built, accessible user interface components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.) that match Tailwind’s styling. It speeds up building polished screens for both public pages and the user dashboard.

- **TanStack React Query**  
  A library that simplifies retrieving and updating data from our backend. It ensures the app stays responsive and in sync with the server without extra boilerplate code.

- **Custom React Hooks**  
  Small, reusable functions (in the `hooks/` folder) that help share logic—like fetching data or tracking form state—across different parts of the app.

## 2. Backend Technologies

These tools power the behind-the-scenes logic, data storage, and integrations:

- **Supabase with PostgreSQL**  
  Supabase gives us a managed PostgreSQL database plus helpful APIs. We store user accounts, subscription status, and any data generated by your AI features here. Supabase also provides migration scripts (SQL files) so we can evolve the database safely over time.

- **Clerk**  
  A drop-in authentication service that handles sign-up, sign-in, password resets, and user profiles. It saves hours of work and ensures best-practice security.

- **Stripe**  
  The leading service for online payments. The app includes code to create and manage subscriptions, and a webhook endpoint that automatically responds when a payment event happens.

- **OpenAI API (via `utils/ai/openai.ts`)**  
  This is the starting point for your AI automation logic. It handles all communication with OpenAI models and keeps your API keys secure on the server.

- **Next.js API Routes & Server Actions**  
  Built-in ways to run server-side code for tasks like processing payments, talking to the database, or calling the AI service. They keep sensitive logic out of the user’s browser.

- **Utility Modules**  
  - `utils/supabase/`: Central place for database queries.  
  - `utils/stripe/`: Helpers for creating and responding to Stripe transactions.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

These choices ensure the app is reliable, easy to update, and can grow with your user base:

- **Vercel**  
  A hosting platform optimized for Next.js. It automatically builds and deploys your site whenever you push code, enabling instant updates and global performance.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control system and remote repository. Every change is tracked, reviewed, and reversible, making teamwork safer and more transparent.

- **Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
  Vercel’s built-in pipeline runs tests (if present) and deploys changes automatically. This ensures minimal downtime and a consistent delivery process.

- **Supabase Cloud**  
  Managed database hosting so you don’t have to worry about server maintenance, backups, or scaling.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

These external services enhance core functionality without reinventing the wheel:

- **Clerk**  
  Manages user accounts and keeps authentication flows secure and up to date.

- **Stripe**  
  Processes payments and recurring subscriptions with industry-standard reliability.

- **OpenAI**  
  Powers the AI features of Train-IA, allowing you to build advanced automation logic without hosting your own models.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve built in multiple layers of protection and optimizations:

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Clerk handles password hashing, email verification, and session management so you don’t have to roll your own.

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**  
  Supabase lets us enforce database rules so each user can only see their own data.

- **Environment Variables**  
  API keys and secrets (for OpenAI, Stripe, Clerk) are stored outside the code, preventing accidental exposure.

- **Server-Side Logic**  
  All calls to payment processors and AI services run on the server. This protects your keys and ensures business rules are enforced centrally.

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  - Next.js pre-renders pages where possible for fast load times.  
  - React Query caches data to reduce unnecessary requests.  
  - Tailwind produces small, focused CSS bundles for speedy styling.

- **Error Handling & Monitoring (Recommended)**  
  Consider adding tools like Zod for input validation, Sentry for error tracking, and Pino for structured logging to catch issues early and keep the app stable.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Train-IA is built on a modern, end-to-end SaaS starter kit that:

- Uses **Next.js 14** and **TypeScript** for a fast, maintainable frontend.  
- Leverages **Clerk**, **Supabase**, and **Stripe** for secure user management, data storage, and payments.  
- Integrates **OpenAI** for the core AI automation features.  
- Deploys effortlessly on **Vercel**, ensuring reliability and scalability.

This stack was chosen to help you move quickly from prototype to production, with clear upgrade paths for validation, testing, and performance monitoring. It offers a solid foundation so you can focus on what really matters: delivering powerful AI-driven automations to your users.
